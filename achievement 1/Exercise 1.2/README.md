# Data Types


Learning Goals
- Explain variable and data types in Python
- Summarise the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

Step 1
I have chosen to use the dictionaries data structure to display the recipe information (name, cooking time and ingredients). I chose this structure because I think the information would be best displayed using key value pairs.


Step 3
I have chosen to use a list to display all my recipes. I chose this structure as the information inside the list can be modified e.g new recipes can be added, recipes can be deleted and/or rearranged.
