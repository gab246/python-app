# Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

Front end is what the user can see when they land on a web browser, the look of the page. This includes colors, styles, buttons etc. Whereas the back end focuses on what the user cannot see. It is for storing and organising data, ensuring everything on the front end side functions and achieves its purpose. APIs, authorisation and authentication as well as wiring with databases would be the kinds of tasks that a backend developer would work on. 


Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? (Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

Python and Javascript are both high level scripting languages that use dynamic typing. A main benefit of using Python is its readability, making it accessible to many developers. Simple built in package management and open source are also a desirable feature of Python, which assist in meeting the demands of the project. Lastly, strong community support are also beneficial in the development process and beyond.


Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

	My three goals are for this achievement are:
	- to learn the main functions of Python
	- to create a working app that runs smoothly and meets its purpose
	- to learn how to write functioning scripts

	I am open to working in front end or back end once I complete my studies.
